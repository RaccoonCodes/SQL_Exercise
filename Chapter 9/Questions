Exercise 9-1: 
Write a SELECT statement that returns two columns based on the Vendors 
table. The first column, Contact, is the vendor contact name in this format: 
first name followed by last initial (for example, "John S.") The second 
column, Phone, is the VendorPhone column without the area code. Only 
return rows for those vendors in the 559 area code. Sort the result set by first 
name, then last name.

Exercise 9-2: 
Write a SELECT statement that returns the lnvoiceNumber and balance due 
for every invoice with a non-zero balance and an InvoiceDueDate that's less 
than 30 days from today. 

Exercise 9-3:
Modify the search expression for InvoiceDueDate from the solution for 
exercise 2. Rather than 30 days from today, return invoices due before the last 
day of the current month. 

Exercise 9-4:
Write a summary query that uses the CUBE operator to return LineltemSum 
(which is the sum of InvoiceLineltemAmount) grouped by Account (an alias 
for AccountDescription) and State (an alias for VendorState). Use the CASE 
and GROUPING function to substitute the literal value "*ALL*" for the 
summary rows with null values.
