1. Create a new database named Membership. 

2. Write the CREATE TABLE statements needed to implement the following 
design in the Membership database. Include foreign key constraints. Define 
IndividualiD and GroupiD as identity columns. Decide which columns should 
allow null values, if any, and explain your decision. Define the Dues column 
with a default of zero and a check constraint to allow only positive values. 

3. Write the CREATE INDEX statements to create a clustered index on the 
GroupiD column and a nonclustered index on the IndividualiD column of the 
GroupMembership table. 

4. Write an ALTER TABLE statement that adds a new column, DuesPaid, to 
the Individuals table. Use the bit data type, disallow null values, and assign a 
default Boolean value of False. 

5. Write an ALTER TABLE statement that adds two new check constraints to the 
Invoices table of the AP database. The first should allow 
(1) PaymentDate to be null only if PaymentTotal is zero and 
(2) PaymentDate to be not null only if PaymentTotal is greater than zero. The second constraint should prevent the 
sum of PaymentTotal and CreditTotal from being greater than Invoice Total. 

6. Delete the GroupMembership table from the Membership database. Then, 
write a CREATE TABLE statement that recreates the table, this time with 
a unique constraint that prevents an individual from being a member in the 
same group twice.
